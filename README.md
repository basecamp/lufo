# Lufo for jQuery
### A jQuery plugin to track the most recent options chosen on a `<select>` element and display them at the top of the list

Long `<select>` menus many options can be a pain. States/territories, countries, currency lists, etc. have so many options that scrolling through them to find the ones you use often is cumbersome. If you can easily identify the demographics of people using your site, you can solve this by manually moving more popular options to the top of the list, but if your site is used globally, or by a wide variety of people with different needs, this method isn’t helpful for anyone.

Lufo works on local level. It tracks the most recent selections on a long `<select>` menu and stores them in a browser’s `localStorage` (it falls back to a tracking cookie if the browser doesn’t support `localStorage`). When someone revisits a page with that same long menu, their most-recently selected options will be copied to the top of the list for their convenience. No bias on your part. Super-convenient for the people using your site.

You can add Lufo to just about any `<select>` form control, choose to group the recent selects, customize (or hide) the labels and divider text, and even enable/disable Lufo based on how many options are in a dynamically-generated `<select>`.

## Usage

1. Include [jQuery](http://jquery.com) in your project
2. Include the Lufo plugin code:

  ```html
  <script src="jquery.lufo.js"></script>
  ```

3. Call the Lufo plugin on a `<select>` element:

  ```javascript
  $('select').lufo();
  ```
  
  If you are using the plugin with multiple, _different_, `<select>` menus, you will want to specify a unique storage name for each menu:
  
  ```javascript
  $('select.some-select').lufo({
    listStoreName: 'someSelectValues'
  });
  ```

## Options

Unless otherwise noted, all option examples below are Lufo defaults.

#### Check for Initial Placeholder Values
If your `<select>` menu has a built-in placeholder (for example: “Select a country…”) that resides at the top of the list and has no value, Lufo will check for it, and if found, move it to the very top of the list _after_ adding in the most-recently selected options.

```javascript
checkInitialValue: true
```

Set to `false` to turn off this check.

#### Strip “selected” from Cloned Values
If a recent option has the selected attribute set (`selected="selected"`) it will remain when that `<option>` is copied to the top of the list.

```javascript
stripSelected: false
```

Set `stripSelected` to `true` if you want the selected attribute removed from the copy.

#### A Title for the Recently Selected List
By default, Lufo will place a disabled `<option>` at the beginning of the most-recently selected options list with the text: “Recently selected:”.

```javascript
recentsListTitleEnabled: true,
recentsListTitle: 'Recently selected:'
```

Turn the title off by setting `recentsListTitleEnabled` to `false` or change the title text by setting `recentsListTitle` to something else.

#### List Divider
Lufo will place a disabled `<option>` at the end of the most-recently selected options list to use as a divider.

```javascript
dividerEnabled: true
dividerText: '––––––––––––––––––––––––'
```

You may disable the divider by setting `dividerEnabled` to `false` or modify the divider by setting `dividerText` to something else.

#### Recently Selected List Memory
By default, Lufo will remember the `5` most-recently selected items in a `<select>` menu.

```javascript
recentsListLength: 5
```

You may change this number to any positive integer.

#### Conditionally Enabling Lufo
A `<select>` list must have at least `5` items in it to enable the tracking and display of recently selected items. This is especially useful for dynamic lists in an app that may need to grow over time before it becomes useful to track recent selects.

```javascript
listMinimumLength: 5
```

You may change this number to any positive integer to enable Lufo sooner, or to wait until a list grows beyond five options.

#### Using `<optgroup>`
By default, Lufo adds the list of recent selects to the top-level of a `<select>` menu.

```javascript
groupList: false
```

If you wish to group the options into an `<optgroup>` set `groupList` to `true`.

#### Ignoring Certain Values
Lufo will track clicks on _all_ available `<option>` in a `<select>`.

If you wish to ignore a few options in the list, you may create an array of the _values_ (`value=`) that you do not want Lufo to track.

**Example:**

```javascript
ignoredValues: ['dog', 'cat', 'cow']
```

Setting the above option would not track clicks on any options in a `<select>` that contain the values of `dog`, `cat`, or `cow`.

#### Storage & Tracking Cookie Preferences
If you will be using Lufo on a single `<select>` menu on your site, you don’t need to change any of the storage preferences. Lufo will use a browser’s `localStorage` (or if that isn’t available, set a tracking cookie) to remember the most recent selections.

**Default:**

```javascript
listStoreName: 'recentOptionValues',
cookieAge: 30 // only relevante for browsers without `localStorage`
```

However, if you are using Lufo on multiple menus with different values, you need to set a unique storage item name for each of the menus.

**Example:**

```javascript
$('select.some-select').lufo({
  listStoreName: 'someSelectValues'
});

$('select.other-select').lufo({
  listStoreName: 'otherSelectValues'
});
```

You may also increase or decrease the amount of time the tracking cookie persists on your site (for browsers without `localStorage`). The default cookie age is `30` days. You may change it by setting `cookieAge` to another positive integer to represent a number of _days_.

**Example:**

```javascript
cookieAge: 90
```

The example above would remember the recently selected options for `90` days instead of the default `30`.

## Examples

#### Example #1
Set Lufo to track a `<select>` with the class name `countries` and set a unique storage item name based on that class name.

```javascript
$('select.countries').lufo({
  listStoreName: 'countriesSelectValues'
});
```

#### Example #2
Set Lufo to track a `<select>` with the ID `author_id`, and a unique storage item name. Only enable Lufo if the list grows to `10` items. Only show `3` of the most recently selected items. Ignore a value of `none`. Finally, turn off the divider, shorten the recent list title, and move the recent selects into an `<optgroup`>.

```javascript
$('#author_id').lufo({
  groupList: true,
  recentsListTitle: 'Recent',
  dividerEnabled: false,
  recentsListLength: 3,
  listMinimumLength: 10,
  ignoredValues: ['none'],
  listStoreName: 'authorIdSelectValues'
});
```
